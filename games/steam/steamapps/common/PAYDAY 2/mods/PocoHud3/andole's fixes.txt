2017.07.19
-When there is no more body bags in the body bag case, the hud will not create a floating label for it.
-If player replenishes health with a first aid kit, it will be represented in the chat message, so that it is clear that the player didn't just use a medic bag without having been downed.

-When a convert dies, the chat message now displays the location of his death, instead of his owner's location.
-When a convert dies, the chat message now displays the type of cop he was, instead of the type of cop who killed him.
-Fixed the chat message about messiah skill.
-Desync resolve disabled and removed from options menu.
-Corpse limit setting disabled and removed from options menu.
-The hud now supports separate files for localization of the ingame text (like chat text). English text is stored in 'Hud3_LocaleIngame.lua' and it always needs to be in the folder. Files for other languages need to have the same name, but with the language code in the end. For example, 'Hud3_LocaleIngameRU.lua' for russian language. If you want to translate the ingame text to your language then you need to: copy the file with english text, open it with a text editor, translate it, save it and rename it as explained above. Also, you can send me the translated file in your language, so that I could update the mod with it.
-Added support for different languages for the names of the rooms (locations). English is 'hud3_rooms.json' file, files in other languages can be added as described above.
-Options menu now has entries for ingame text language and rooms' names language.
-Russian language support for the ingame text and rooms' names.

2017.07.14
-Accuracy counting fixes (for now it is not counted correctly if players use swan song, bulletstorm or kingpin). For Dragon's breath, once a cop starts burning, it is considered a successful hit. For explosives, every cop that is hit with the explosion is counted as a successful hit.
-Fixed other players' bottom panels disappearing sometimes. They used to reappear once one of their stats got changed, so no big deal here.
-Snipers are now counted as special enemies by the hud.
-If you have 'nine lives' skill then your down counter will only become red when you've been downed 4 (or 2) times. This cannot be done for other players in the lobby.
